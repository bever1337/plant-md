## 💡 Light

Bright, indirect light. No afternoon sunlight.

## 🌊 Watering

Water when the soil feels dry. Do not overwater sago palms.

Sago palms appreciate humidity. You can clean them with a spray bottle.

---

## 💩 Nutrients

Fertilize monthly during the spring and summer. Use a balanced, general-purpose, liquid plant food.

---

## 🌍 Soil

Sago palms prefer well-draining, sandy soil.

---

## 🌱 Potting

Sago palms grow slowly and only need to be repotted every few years.

---

## ❄️ Hardines

Native to Asia, Sago palms prefer a US 9-10 hardiness zone.

---

## 👶 Propagation

Sago palms will produce pups around the base that can be divided. Use clean, sharp tools to divide the plant.

Let the offshoot rest for a few days after removal. Once the offshoot begins to callous, plant in a small pot with standard potting soil. Allow soil to dry between watering.

Propagations may take a couple of months to root.
