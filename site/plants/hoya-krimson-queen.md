## 💡 Light

14 hours of bright, indirect light. No direct, afternoon light.

---

## 🌊 Watering

### Spring, Summer

Water when the top layer is dry. Use room-temperature water spring through summer.

### Autumn, Winter

Hoyas need less water in autumn and winter. Wait for the soil to dry between watering. Use a humidifier.

---

## 💩 Nutrients

Hoya is not a very hungry plant. They need a monthly feeding of standard plant food, orchid mix, or a potassium-rich mix.

---

## 🌍 Soil

Hoya needs a potting mix with good circulation. An equal mix of cactus-mix, orchid-mix, and perlite.

---

## 🌱 Potting

Hoya likes to be crowded and lightly root-bound. Repot every two or three years in early spring.

Leafy vines can be trained to grow along a wire or small trellis.

---

## ❄️ Hardiness

Don't let the temperature drop below 60 degrees. Don't let Hoya touch the glass windows. Hoya is a delicate baby.

Hoya does not go dormant during the winter.

---

## 👶 Propagation

Take 3 inch long cuttings with at least one pair of leaves and a node. Cuttings will root in moist potting mix, water, or a medium.

---

## 🌼 Blooming, Pruning

Never trim stems with no leaves. Stems with no leaves are spurs and will produce flowers.

Don't move a budding or blossoming hoya. Bright, indirect light is required for hoya to blossom.

Prune vegetation in early spring before growth.

---

## 🐞 Diseases, Pests

Watch out for standard indoor pests like fungus gnats caused by overwatering. Mealybugs may be attracted to the leaves. Aphids like the hoya's flowers.
